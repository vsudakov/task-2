# Task 2

- to run the app: `yarn install && yarn run start`
- to run tests: `yarn run test`
  - test is located in [src/components/PersonalInfoDiv/PersonalInfoDiv.test.js](./src/components/PersonalInfoDiv/PersonalInfoDiv.test.js)

the following additional tests can be implemented:

- mock "fetch" function in order to respond by an error and then check if an error message is displayed
- steps are displayed in a proper order
- check that "Prev"/"Next" buttons are enabled/disabled when needed

what can be improved overall:

- more polished html layout
- add spinners when waiting for responses
- utilize more different components from Ant library to make interface richer
- validations for input fields
